**Tracing Modes**
 - Linear Tracing
 - Hi-Z Tracing

Hi Z tracing requires "Depth Pyramid" render feature to be added in the pipeline asset. The Depth Pyramid is included in this package.

**Changing settings during runtime**

    void LimSSR.SetSettings(ScreenSpaceReflectionsSettings o)

-  `o.StepStrideLength` = The length of each ray march stride. Increasing this will reduce image quality but allow for further objects to be visible in the reflections.
-  `o.MaxSteps` = The number of steps the shader does before ending the ray march. Increasing this will allow further objects to be visible in the reflections but reduce performance.
-  `o.Downsample` = The number of times the working resolution is downscaled. Increasing this will reduce image quality but increase performance.
-  `o.MinSmoothness` = The minimum smoothness of a material has to be in order to have reflections.
> For the best quality, try to minimize `StepStrideLength` and maximize `MaxSteps`

    bool LimSSR.Enabled

- `True`: Enables effect
- `False`: Disables effect
> Enables or disables the SSR shader

    static RaytraceModes TracingMode

> Sets the tracing mode: Linear tracing, or Hi Z tracing
