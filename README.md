# Unity-ScreenSpaceReflections-URP

SSR solution for Unity URP. Supports Linear Tracing and Hi Z tracing. The package includes SSR render feature and Hierarchical Min-Z Depth Buffer render feature. 
**Created by Joshua Lim**

## **9/4/2023 4.0.0 Changelog**

New Features
 - Added Dithering settings (bayer 8x8 noise vs interleaved gradient noise) 
 - SSR can now traverse behind objects (improved thickness checking)
 
Bug fixes
 - Fixed non power of 2 resolution artifacts
 - Increased hi-z tracing quality
 - Improved reflection blending to better represent pbr materials

# **Installation Instructions:**

**Instructions**:
1. Copy: "https://github.com/JoshuaLim007/Unity-ScreenSpaceReflections-URP.git"
2. Go into the package manager in unity
3. Select "add package from git url"
4. Paste the link into the text entry
5. Press "add"

**Requirements**:
- Unity URP 12 or newer
- Unity 2021 LTS or newer  

In your URP Asset

**Tracing Modes**

- Linear Tracing

- Hi-Z Tracing

![enter image description here](https://i.imgur.com/8ewV9b7.png)
Hi Z tracing requires "Depth Pyramid" render feature to be added in the pipeline asset. The Depth Pyramid is included in this package.

## **Changing settings during runtime**

### void LimSSR.SetSettings(ScreenSpaceReflectionsSettings o)


-  `o.StepStrideLength` = The length of each ray march stride. Increasing this will reduce image quality but allow for further objects to be visible in the reflections.

-  `o.MaxSteps` = The number of steps the shader does before ending the ray march. Increasing this will allow further objects to be visible in the reflections but reduce performance.

-  `o.Downsample` = The number of times the working resolution is downscaled. Increasing this will reduce image quality but increase performance.

-  `o.MinSmoothness` = The minimum smoothness of a material has to be in order to have reflections.

> For the best quality, try to minimize `StepStrideLength` and maximize `MaxSteps`


### bool LimSSR.Enabled

-  `True`: Enables effect
-  `False`: Disables effect

> Enables or disables the SSR shader

static RaytraceModes TracingMode

> Sets the tracing mode: Linear tracing, or Hi Z tracing

# Known Limitations and bugs
- Wider apart the near and far clip plane, more banding artifact appears.
- Far reflections are inaccurate and have banding artifact.
- Transparent objects cannot have reflections.
- Transparent objects are not correctly reflected onto objects.
- Downsampling ssr on hi-trace mode causes it to break.
- Current fix for non-power of 2 resolutions causes warping around edges of objects with a reflection behind it.
- Hi-z trace cannot have camera facing reflections.
- No support for VR and Mobile devices
